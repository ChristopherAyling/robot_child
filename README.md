# Robot

![A small robot with a metal chassis, 4 omni wheels and an arduino](robot_small.png)

This is the repo for my robot project. It will eventually do everything.

SLAM, pathfinding, behaviour trees, speech recogition, object manipulation etc

This repo is organised into Python code for protoyping and c++ code for deploying on hardware.
